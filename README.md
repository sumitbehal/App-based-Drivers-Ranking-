# App-based-Drivers-Ranking-
It is a  script that ranks delivery drivers in order. Have two drivers by default and an option to add more drivers to ranking algorithm as needed. Each driver has 3 inputs. 1)	Number of destinations/stops in a route 2)	Total route distance 3)	Total time of route Each driver can be given a different number of destinations for their route. Each driverâ€™s destinations will be different distances apart from each other compared to other drivers. Each driver will usually complete their route in a different amount of time, since they will have different number of destinations and different distances. Considering all this, I would like the drivers ranked from highest to lowest.
